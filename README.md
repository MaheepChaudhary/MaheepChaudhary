I am 

<span style="font-size: 0.9em">I am currently a Master's student in <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/">NTU, Singapore</a> under the guidance <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/about-us/past-chairs/prof-ong-yew-soon">Prof. Ong Yee Soon</a> - <em>President's Chair Professor of Computer Science at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)</em>. Beside, that I am working with <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> under the expert guidance of <a href="https://atticusg.github.io/">Dr. Atticus Geiger</a>. In this role, I am actively engaged in a research endeavor that delves into the intricacies of neural networks. My focus involves interventions employing causality as a tool to enhance interpretability and fortify the robustness of these neural networks. This experience has provided valuable insights into the inner workings of these systems and their potential applications in advancing the field.

<span style="font-size: 0.9em">Previously, I worked for 2 years under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nZxJGeUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Mr. Haohan Wang</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, USA, where I wrote a survey on Trustworthiness in Machine Learning from Causal Perspective: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16851">Towards Trustworthy and Aligned Machine Learning: A Data-centric Survey with Causality Perspectives</a>. <em>You can access my latest work under preparation using this <a href="https://github.com/MaheepChaudhary/Causation-inComputerVision">link.</a></em>. Previously, I had worked with <a href="http://driverless.mit.edu/">MIT Driverless</a> on Self-Driving Car as Computer Vision Engineer and also participated in <a href="https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/">Indus Autonomous Challenge</a>. In addition to that I have also worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=TBcGmiwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Shitala Prasad, A*star, Singapore</a> where I worked on Caption Generation using the MANN, which is currently being reviewed. Additionally, I have worked on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06206">Reminder Cum Recommendation System</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=OR0yLJEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Chandresh Kumar Maurya</a>, IIT Indore which was successfully submitted to Cods-COMAD: ACM IKDD 2021. Besides that, I have also worked on the Recommendation Engine Research Project under <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=5kG-VWMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Prof. Mrityunjay Singh</a> (Funded by AICTE) in JUIT, Wagnakhat for one year and have submitted the paper in the Information Sciences journal. I have also been a <strong>winner</strong> in the <a href="https://www.sih.gov.in/">Smart India Hackathon</a>(World's Biggest Hackathon) solving the problem proposed by the <a href="https://bprd.nic.in/">Beaureau of Research and Development</a>(BPRD) regarding Facial Recognition. I have also been shortlisted by AICTE to represent India as <strong>Team Leader in ASEAN-India Hackathon</strong>, which was held between 11 ASEAN countries.
